The server receives POSTs, or streams of messages over websocket of distinct JSON objects that are injected directly into the backend storage implementation.

There are several implementations:
 * sqlite using sqlite3's JSONB support
 * duckdb
 * json-files, committing zstd compressed files that are intended to be consumed using a duckdb database using views.
 * [postgres](POSTGRES.adoc), contributed by @afjoseph.
